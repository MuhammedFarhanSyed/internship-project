## ðŸŽ¨ Design and Development Approach

- **UI Design**: Inspired by CoinMarketCap, focusing on a clean and intuitive layout.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS was used for efficient and responsive styling.
- **State Management**: All live cryptocurrency data is managed within the Redux state for consistency and predictability.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Simulated using randomized price and volume changes at regular intervals.
- **Codebase**: Emphasizes modularity and reusability for maintainability and scalability.
